# codeforces_problems
probably awful codeforces solutions



I've created this collection of problems that I've completed so that I can orgonize them well for future reference. 
I guess I would've just done this on my computer and not used github (might have even been more orgonized) but with this way of storing my code, I can easily share solutions with my friends as we collectively improve out programming skills


All projects in this folder will be done in Python until I learn another language. 

Hopefully this folder will hold programs in Python only for the next 3 months until around August 2020 in which I should've learned java. From then on there will be a collection of solutions in Java and Python. After that, it won't be until around a year from now until I am able to start solving problems in C++. I look forward to that day.
